## 🔍 Overview

The **Palisade Hotel Reservation System** is a desktop application that simulates a complete hotel management workflow. The system supports three distinct user roles — Guest, Receptionist, and Admin — each with a dedicated menu and set of capabilities.

The project was implemented with a **dual-interface approach**:

- A **Console UI** (terminal-based) providing all core system functionality through clean, formatted menus.
- A **JavaFX GUI** providing a visual interface for login, registration, and core guest/receptionist interactions.

All data is managed in-memory via a central static `DataBase` class and pre-populated with realistic demo data on startup.

## ✨ Features

### 👤 Guest
- Browse all available rooms with type, amenities, and pricing
- Make room reservations with check-in / check-out date selection
- View all personal reservations with status tracking
- Cancel pending reservations
- Pay invoices and complete checkout with balance deduction

### 🛎️ Receptionist
- Check guests in directly (creates a CONFIRMED reservation)
- Check guests out with payment collection (Cash or Credit Card)
- View all pending reservation requests
- Accept/confirm pending reservations submitted by guests
- Working-hours tracking per receptionist session

### 🔧 Admin
- **Room Management** — Create, view, update, and delete rooms with full amenity configuration
- **Amenity Management** — Add, update, and delete amenities; changes propagate to all rooms automatically
- **Room Type Management** — Define and manage room categories (Single, Double, Suite, etc.) with referential integrity checks

### 🔐 System-Wide
- Secure login with username/password validation
- Guest self-registration with balance setup
- Protected Staff registration (Admin code required)
- Real-time room occupancy tracking based on active reservations
- Input validation with meaningful error messages throughout

## 📐 Class Diagram

The diagram below provides a complete visual overview of the system's object-oriented design. It captures the full class hierarchy, interface contracts, relationships, and multiplicity across all entities — from the `User` inheritance tree down to `Room`, `Reservation`, `Invoice`, and the supporting enums.

<div align="center">

![Class Diagram.png](src/main/resources/Images/Class%20Diagram.png)

</div>

**Key relationships at a glance:**

- `User` is the root of the inheritance tree — `Guest` and the abstract `Staff` (which branches into `Admin` and `Receptionist`) all extend it.
- `DataBase` acts as the central static store, holding `ArrayList` collections for rooms, reservations, invoices, people, room types, and amenities.
- `Reservation` links a `Guest` to a `Room`, carries a `ReservationStatus` enum (`PENDING → CONFIRMED → COMPLETED / CANCELLED`), and generates exactly one `Invoice`.
- `Room` is categorized as a `RoomType` and includes zero or more `Amenity` items; both implement the `roomstuff` interface alongside `Room` itself.
- `Invoice` holds a `PaymentMethod` enum (`CASH`, `CREDIT_CARD`, `ONLINE`) and references back to its `Reservation`.
- `Validation` is a standalone utility used by `Main` for all scanner-based input sanitization.

## 🧱 Design Patterns & OOP Concepts

This project demonstrates several core Object-Oriented Programming principles as part of the CSE241 curriculum:

**Inheritance**
- `Guest` and `Staff` both extend `User`
- `Admin` and `Receptionist` both extend the abstract `Staff` class

**Polymorphism**
- `Main` dispatches to role-specific menus using `instanceof` checks
- `viewRooms()` is overridden in `Guest` while being defined in `User`

**Encapsulation**
- All entity fields are private with clean getter/setter contracts
- `Validation` class centralizes all input sanitization

**Interfaces**
- `users` — implemented by all user-facing classes
- `roomstuff` — implemented by `Room`, `RoomType`, `Amenity`
- `reservationProcess` — implemented by `Reservation` and `Invoice`

**Method Chaining**
- `Room.addAmenity()` returns `this`, enabling fluent room construction:
  ```java
  new Room(67, suite, 670).addAmenity(gym).addAmenity(coffee);
  ```

**Enum-Based State Management**
- `Reservation.ReservationStatus` — `PENDING`, `CONFIRMED`, `CANCELLED`, `COMPLETED`
- `Invoice.PaymentMethod` — `CASH`, `CREDIT_CARD`, `ONLINE`

## 🎓 Academic Context

This project was developed as a course assignment for:

**CSE241 — Object-Oriented Programming**  
Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University

The system demonstrates practical application of OOP principles including inheritance hierarchies, interface-based contracts, polymorphic dispatch, and encapsulation — applied to a real-world hotel management domain.
